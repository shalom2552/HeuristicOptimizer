# HeuristicOptimizer

## Overview
**HeuristicOptimizer** is a project aimed at enhancing heuristic-based search algorithms within the context of a pathfinding and package delivery simulation. The base code involves boats navigating through a matrix to pick up and drop off packages. The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency and adaptability of the underlying heuristics used for routing and task assignment.

By integrating adaptive heuristic techniques, we aim to optimize search times, solution quality, and resource usage. This project will compare traditional static heuristics with newly implemented dynamic and combined heuristic approaches.

## Features
- **Adaptive Heuristics**: Implements dynamic adjustments to heuristic weights based on search depth and other criteria.
- **Optimized Boat Routing**: Enhances the existing boat routing system by improving the decision-making process using advanced heuristics.
- **Matrix-based Navigation**: Simulates a grid environment where boats navigate, pick up, and deliver packages at designated locations.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Empirically compares static and adaptive heuristics in terms of performance metrics like solution quality, nodes expanded, and search time.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
